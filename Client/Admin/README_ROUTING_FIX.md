# Angular Routing Fix for Page Refresh

## Problem
When you refresh the page on `/dashboard` or any other Angular route, you get a 404 error because the server doesn't know about Angular's client-side routes.

## Solution
I've implemented several fixes to handle client-side routing properly:

### 1. Angular Configuration Updates
- Added `historyApiFallback: true` to the serve configuration in `angular.json`
- This tells the Angular dev server to serve `index.html` for all routes

### 2. Routing Files
- **`src/web.config`**: IIS configuration for proper routing
- **`src/_redirects`**: Netlify-style redirects for SPA routing

### 3. Route Configuration
- The catch-all route `{ path: '**', redirectTo: '', pathMatch: 'full' }` is already in place
- This redirects unknown routes to the login page

### 4. Component Updates
- Enhanced authentication checking in the dashboard component
- Better error handling for navigation

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Restart Angular Server
1. Stop your current Angular development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run the restart script:
   ```bash
   restart_angular.bat
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Restart
1. Stop your current Angular server
2. Run:
   ```bash
   ng serve --port 4200 --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

## What This Fixes
- ✅ **No more 404 errors** when refreshing `/dashboard`
- ✅ **Proper client-side routing** handling
- ✅ **Authentication redirects** work correctly
- ✅ **WebSocket connections** continue to work

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/dashboard` in your browser
2. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. You should **NOT** get a 404 error
4. The page should load normally or redirect to login if not authenticated

## Notes
- The Django server (Daphne) should continue running on port 8000
- The Angular server will run on port 4200
- Both servers need to be running for the full application to work
